Program a function that checks if the given string is a contact. A contact is defined as follows: "name phone number birth number", where:

NAME:

- is one or more words (separated by exactly one space), which are always made up of one uppercase letter at the beginning and one or more lowercase letters. 
  They contain only letters of the English alphabet (no special characters, brackets, commas).

PHONE NUMBER:

- is a number made up of digits (that is, at least one), between which there can be spaces. 
  It may (but may not) start with a “+” sign (there may also be spaces between the plus sign and the first digit).

THE BIRTH NUMBER:

- is made up of exactly six digits, followed by an optional separator (":" or "-") and exactly four other digits 
  (validity, i.e. valid date of birth and divisibility are not of interest to us in this task).
